How to Restart Everything:


Start your Django backend:

	- Open a new cmd window.
	
	- Go to your backend folder:
	
		cd \Users\manue\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\personal-blog-platform\backend
	
	- Activate your virtual environment:
	
		venv\Scripts\activate

	- Start Django:

		python manage.py runserver


Start your React frontend:

	- Open a new cmd window.

	- Go to your frontend folder:

		cd \Users\manue\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\personal-blog-platform\frontend
	
	- Start React:

		npm start
	
Once both servers are running, your app will work in your browser as before!

You need to do this every time you restart your computer or close the terminals.
